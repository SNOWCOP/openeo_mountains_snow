# Snow water equivalent (SWE) reconstruction


https://github.com/SNOWCOP/SWE_reconstruction/blob/main/main.py#L133C15-L133C22

Data inputs:

- reconstructed daily snow cover area timeseries at 20m resolution
- air temperature at 30m reconstructed from ERA5 via MicroMet
- shortwave incoming radiation (SW) at 30m reconstructed from ERA5 via MicroMet
- era5-land precipitation in meters

Algorithm type: multi-band timeseries input is used to compute single-band timeseries output.
